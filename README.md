# UnityExt
A bunch of helpful extension methods for Unity Engine

#### Installation:
Add following entry in your manifest.json as follows:
```C#
"com.kaiyum.unityext": "https://github.com/kaiyumcg/UnityExt.git"
```


Since unity does not support git dependencies, you need the following entries as well:
```C#
"com.kaiyum.attributeext2": "https://github.com/kaiyumcg/NaughtyAttributes",
"com.kaiyum.editorutil": "https://github.com/kaiyumcg/EditorUtil.git"
```
Add them into your manifest.json file in "Packages\" directory of your unity project, if they are already not in manifest.json file.
